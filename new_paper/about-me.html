          Hello! I'm Kunal. I've been a professional web developer for over 1
          year. I'm passionate about music and creating user-friendly websites
          that help businesses grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in Varanasi and attended College of Engineering Roorkee.
          Over the years, I've had the chance to work on e-commerce websites,
          personal blogs, and online portfolios.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking, football, listening to music,
          writing, and playing games sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for visiting my website. If you'd like to get in touch or
          learn more about my work, please visit the Contact and Portfolio
